An abridged version of the card game. Using a random number generator (rng) based on values between 1 to 13, you must face off against the dealer (bot) that is using the same rng.

To win, your hand value must be greater than the dealer's hand value. If your hand value is at 21, you automatically win.
To tie, you must have the same hand value as the dealer
To lose, you must have a lower hand value than the dealer.

Using the command prompt, you must select the menu choices by typing the number corresponding to the choice you want.

Menu Choices:
1) Get another card: this allows you to retrieve another card from the dealer, increasing the value of your hand. The game will tell you what card you received (based on a numeric value from the rng).
2) Hold hand: do not receive any more cards and stay with the hand you have. If you have a higher value than the dealer, you win!
3) Print Statistics: This will show you how many times you won, the dealer won, the number of tie games, total games played, and the percentage of player wins.
4) Exit: exits the game and thus the program
